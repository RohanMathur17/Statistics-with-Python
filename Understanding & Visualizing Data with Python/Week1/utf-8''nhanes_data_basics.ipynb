    "### Importing libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "When using Python, you must always begin your scripts by importing the libraries that you will be using. After importing a library, its functions can then be called from your code by prepending the library name to the function name.  For example, to use the '`dot`' function from the '`numpy`' library, you would enter '`numpy.dot`'.  To avoid repeatedly having to type the libary name in your scripts, it is conventional to define a two or three letter abbreviation for each library, e.g. '`numpy`' is usually abbreviated as '`np`'.  This allows us to use '`np.dot`' instead of '`numpy.dot`'.  Similarly, the Pandas library is typically abbreviated as '`pd`'.\n",

This is a somewhat obscure format, and while Pandas is perfectly capable of reading the NHANES data directly from the xport files, accomplishing this task is a more advanced topic than we want to get into here.

Pandas also has a one-dimensional data structure called a `Series` that we will encounter occasionally.\n",

The '`read_csv`' function by default expects the first row of the data file to contain column names.  \n",

    "Using '`read_csv`' in its default mode is fairly straightforward.  There are many options to '`read_csv`' that are useful for handling less-common situations.  For example, you would use the option `sep='\\t'` instead of the default `sep=','` if the fields of your data file are delimited by tabs instead of commas.  See [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) for the full documentation for '`read_csv`'.\n",

If you have the data file in your local filesystem, you can also use '`read_csv`' to read the data from this file.  In this case you would pass a file path instead of a URL, e.g. `pd.read_csv(\"my_file.csv\")` would read a file named `my_file.csv` that is located in your current working directory."
