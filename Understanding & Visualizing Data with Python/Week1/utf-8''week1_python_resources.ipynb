    "### Python Resources\n",
    "The purpose of this document is to direct you to resources that you may find useful if you decide to do a deeper dive into Python. This course is not meant to be an introduction to programming, nor an introduction to Python, but if you find yourself interested in exploring Python further, or feel as if this is a useful skill, this document aims to direct you to resources that you may find useful. If you have a background in Python or programming, a style guides are included below to show how Python may differ from other programming languages or give you a launching point for diving deeper into more advanced packages. This course does not endorse the use or non-use of any particular resource, but the author has found these resources useful in their exploration of programming and Python in particular\n",

    "### The Python Documentation\n",
    "Any reference that does not begin with the Python documentation would not be complete. The authors of the language, as well as the community that supports it, have developed a great set of tutorials, documentation, and references around Python. When in doubt, this is often the first place that you should look if you run into a scary error or would like to learn more about a specific function. The documentation can be found here: [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)\n",

    "Below are resources to help you along your way in learning Python. While it is great to consume material, in programming there is no substitute for actually writing code. For every hour that you spend learning, you should spend about twice that amount of time writing code for cool problems or working out examples. Coding is best learned through actually coding!\n",

    "* [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=python) has several offerings for Python that you can take in addition to this course. These courses will go into depth into Python programming and how to use it in an applied setting \n",
    "* [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) is another resources that is great for learning Python (and other programming languages). While not as focused as Cousera, this is a quick way to get up-and-running with Python\n",
    "* YouTube is another great resource for online learning and there are several \"courses\" for learning Python. We recommend trying several sets of videos to see which you like best and using multiple video series to learn since each will present the material in a slightly different way\n",
    "* There are tens of books on programming in Python that are great if you prefer to read. More so than the other resources, be sure to code what you learn. It is easy to read about coding, but you really learn to code by coding!\n",
    "* If you have a background in coding, the authors have found the tutorial at [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm) to be useful in getting started with Python. This tutorial assumes that you have some background in coding in another language"
